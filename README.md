Collection of Projects in Genetics and Genomics including Genome Wide Association Analysis &amp; Up-regulated Gene identification.

This repository contains code and instructions for 2 projects:


> **GWAS**: Genome Wide Association Study where association of population SNP variations with cardiovascular phenotype is investigated through statistical testing. This is done in order to identify the most significant SNPs potentailly responsible for a better or worse cholesterol phenotype. 


> **Transcriptomics**: The focus of this project was to identify genes that were the most up-regulated and down regulated in different types of cells from pre-adipocytes to adipocytes. This was done once again through statistical testing.
